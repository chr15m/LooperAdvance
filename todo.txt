todo:
- add nifty background to pages
- implement time stretching
- add font (when fenris has done it)

version 2:
- make load/save format more robust & backwards compatible for future versions (data types stored with data)
- allow for different panning positions
- allow for different volumes (Evans)
- interface changes:
	- b button = browse notes (Jordan)
	- start button = on/off (Jordan)
	- pause button = remember/recall current loop settings
	- rename beat and note to slice and step (Jordan)
	- display current note position for this loop
	- holding down button on select & number boxes will scroll (Evans)
	- option to 'wrap' on select/number boxes (Evans)
	- better letter selection (more intuitive?)
	- note numbering should line up on specific note selector (Jordan)
- when creating new notes, use settings of last note if less than loop length, otherwise use same note 1 loop length ago
- when adding a new loop, jumps to that loop
- 'clone loop' button
