You can also use the following options with make:

* TARGET=buildname
	buildname can be any of `ls [a-z]*test.cc`
	e.g. make TARGET=clarkinoutest
	which will build clarkinoutest.gba
	(default is TARGET=looper)

* THEME=themename
	themename should be a directory under screens/
	see the readme under screens/ and also the example 'basic'
	you can modify those graphics to make your own theme
